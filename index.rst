Welcome to the SimpleUI documentation!
============================================

**SimpleUI** is a completely free framework for creating business applications for Android with instant deployment on devices. These can be online or completely independent (offline) mobile workplaces for accounting systems (ERP,WMS,MES and others) for Android devices - mobile phones, bacrode terminals, tablets, electronic kiosks. The platform executes user configurations with code interpretation both locally (python or javascript) and online (in the language of back-systems) and is focused on maximum performance for high-load solutions. With the help of the same designer, semantics and set of commands, you can create workplaces for PCs based on web clients, make your own cloud solutions on the open SimpleWEB framework (on which, in turn, the cloud designer for the platform is written).

**The main mission of Simple is to simplify the development and support processes as much as possible due to a special solution architecture, due to the structuring of visual forms, events and their handlers.** This is not No-code, since I consider No-Code to be insufficiently flexible and universal - this is **Low-code**, which allows you to create solutions, **with the performance of native applications** and even higher (see examples). This is intentionally not a cross-platform framework. Instead, it is maximally focused on the deep use of the capabilities of the base platform, style and Google recommendations, which cannot be achieved in cross-platform frameworks, which are forced to offer equal capabilities on all platforms.
